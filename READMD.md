<p> Spring Boot helps you to create Spring-powered, production-grade applications and services with absolute minimum fuss. It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform so that new and existing users can quickly get to the bits they need.

### Installation and Getting Started

```SprinBoot
// Here is a quick teaser of a complete Spring Boot application in Java:
import org.springframework.boot.*;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.*;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@SpringBootApplication
public class Example {

	@RequestMapping("/")
	String home() {
		return "Hello World!";
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Example.class, args);
	}

}
```

### Getting Help

```sh
Are you having trouble with Spring Boot? We want to help!

* Check the reference documentation, especially the How-to’s — they provide solutions to the most common questions.

* Learn the Spring basics — Spring Boot builds on many other Spring projects; check the spring.io website for a wealth of reference documentation. If you are new to Spring, try one of the guides.

* If you are upgrading, read the release notes for upgrade instructions and "new and noteworthy" features.

* Ask a question — we monitor stackoverflow.com for questions tagged with spring-boot. You can also chat with the community on Gitter.

* Report bugs with Spring Boot at github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues.
```

### Reporting Issues

````sh
Spring Boot uses GitHub’s integrated issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you log a bug, please search the issue tracker to see if someone has already reported the problem.

* If the issue doesn’t already exist, create a new issue.

* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report. We like to know the Spring Boot version, operating system, and JVM version you’re using.

* If you need to paste code or include a stack trace, use Markdown. ``` escapes before and after your text.

* If possible, try to create a test case or project that replicates the problem and attach it to the issue.
